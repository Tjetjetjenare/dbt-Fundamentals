#dbt Fundamentals
Welcome to the dbt Fundamentals project repository! This project demonstrates foundational concepts and best practices for building robust data transformation workflows using dbt (Data Build Tool).

📚 Project Overview
This project is designed as a hands-on learning environment for mastering dbt. It focuses on creating modular, maintainable, and scalable data models while leveraging dbt's powerful features like tests, documentation, and lineage tracking.

Key highlights include:

A foundational project structure.
Implementation of staging and mart models.
Use of dbt's built-in testing and documentation capabilities.
Integration of the latest dbt features, such as data_tests: introduced in version 1.8.
🗂️ Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

├── models/
│   ├── staging/          # Source data transformations
│   ├── marts/            # Business logic and aggregations
│   └── snapshots/        # Snapshots for historical analysis
├── macros/               # Custom Jinja macros
├── tests/                # Custom tests for data validation
├── seeds/                # Static seed files for reference data
├── dbt_project.yml       # dbt project configuration
└── README.md             # Project documentation
🚀 Key Features
Modular Design: Separation of staging and mart layers for clear logic.
Robust Testing: Use of data_tests: and traditional tests: to ensure data quality.
Comprehensive Documentation: Built-in dbt documentation to track model dependencies and definitions.
Extensibility: Demonstrates how to extend dbt with custom macros and packages.
