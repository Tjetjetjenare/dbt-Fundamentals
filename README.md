# dbt Fundamentals
Welcome to my **dbt Fundamentals** project repository! This project was created by following the instructions provided in the [dbt Fundamentals course](https://learn.getdbt.com/courses/dbt-fundamentals) to help me learn the foundational steps of transforming data using dbt Cloud.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview
This project serves as a hands-on learning environment to master dbt's core concepts, including:

- **Connecting dbt Cloud to a data warehouse and Git repository**
- **Exploring key concepts like modeling, sources, testing, documentation, and deployment**
- **Building models and running tests in dbt Cloud**

The course duration is approximately 5 hours.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
1. Modular Design: Separation of staging and mart layers for clear logic.
2. Robust Testing: Implementation of dbt's built-in testing capabilities to ensure data quality.
3. Comprehensive Documentation: Utilization of dbt's documentation features to track model dependencies and definitions.
4. Deployment: Guidance on deploying your dbt project effectively.
